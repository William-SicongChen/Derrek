        <h1>Plans/Goals</h1>
        <h2>
          <ul class="plans">
            <li>I want to be able to hold a back and forth conversation. 
                <br>
                It could be as simple as this 
                <br>
                Teacher: "Hi, Derrek!"
                <br>
                Me: "Hi, Mrs. Andresen!"            
            </li>
            <li>I want to be able to do cooperative plays with teachers and peers.</li>
            <li>I have only eaten a few times outside my home. <br>
                I plan to be more comfortable eating outside home. <br>
                I like going to school, so school may be a good place to start.
            </li>
            <li>I want to transition from diapers to underpants soon.</li>
            <li>I hope to be able to do activities following teachers' instructions step by step.</li>

        <h1>WHAT WORKS</h1>
        <h4>
          <ul>
            <li>I listen and follow commands said by soft tones.</li>
            <li>I understand emotions better by reading facial expressions.</li>
            <li>When everyone else is doing something, I would be more interested in joining.</li>
            <li>When I am overloaded by emotions, I may calm down with some physical interactions.
                <br>
                Such as pressing/holding my hands firmly, giving me a firm hug or rubbing my head or my back.
            </li>
            <li>I would understand "no" better when phrased with alternative actions.
              <br>
                For example, 
                <br>if I throw objects, you can tell me "put back the blocks"
                <br>if I climb, you can tell me "hands on the side".
            </li>

        <h1>WHAT DOESN'T</h1>
         <h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Rushing me to do something. Sometimes I may just need to walk away for a few minutes and I will come back.</li>
            <li>Stay in my bubble for too long time. </li>
            <li>Giving me little time to respond. It may take me a little time to respond with words and/or actions. </li>
