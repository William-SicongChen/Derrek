        <h1>Plans/Goals</h1>
        <h2>
          <ul class="plans">
            <li>I want to be able to hold a back and forth conversation without prompting. 
                <br>
                It could be as simple as this 
                <br>
                Teacher: "Hi, Derrek!"
                <br>
                Me: "Hi, Mr. Thomas!"            
            </li>
            <li>I want to be able to do cooperative plays with teachers and peers.</li>
            <li>I haven't eatn many times outside home. <br>
                I plan to be more comfortable eating outside, for example, at school.
            </li>
            <li>I want to transition from a mix of diapers and underpants to fully underpants soon.</li>
            <li>I hope to be able to do activities following teachers' instructions step by step.</li>
            <li>I hope to be able to properly express my emotions when I'm angry or frustrated.</li>

        <h1>WHAT WORKS</h1>
        <h4>
          <ul>
            <li>I listen and follow commands said by soft tones.</li>
            <li>I understand emotions better by reading facial expressions.</li>
            <li>When everyone else is doing something, I would be more interested in joining.</li>
            <li>When I am overloaded by emotions, I may calm down with some physical interactions.
                <br>
                Such as pressing/holding my hands firmly, giving me a firm hug or rubbing my head or my back.
            </li>
            <li>I would understand "no" better when phrased with alternative actions.
              <br>
                For example, 
                <br>if I throw objects, you can tell me "blocks on the table/floor"
                <br>if I climb, you can tell me "hands on the side".
            </li>
          </ul>
        </h4>

        <h1>WHAT DOESN'T</h1>
         <h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Rushing me to do something. Sometimes I may just need to walk away for a few minutes and I will come back.</li>
            <li>Staying in my bubble for too long. </li>
            <li>Giving me little time to respond. It may take me some time to respond with words and/or actions. </li>
            <li>Telling me "No" or "Stop" without talking it through with me.</li>
          </ul>
